# Connect-Four

I implemented a Connect Four game for my Computing III project illustrating the basic concepts of object orientation. When the user starts 
the progarm, they will be given the options to either play against their friend or cpu. There is also an option to look at the credits. If 
the user decides to play against someone, the board will be generated and the user has to input 0-6 inclusively to place a piece a board.
If they input any other input then the program will tell them its invalid and try to make them input 0-6. Just like a regular connect four game,
the program will end when either player gets four in a row or if no one wins after 42 turns which results in a tie.
